# Auth

**TODO: Add description**
Auth
Authentication system for the platform.

Right now, Auth just handles a simple email/password combination.

In the future this could be extended to support:

different authentication strategies, e.g.: username+password for customers, LDAP for operators, OAuth for partners
2FA
tracking sign in count
tracking sign in attempts and locking down
tracking IP
tracking sign ins from multiple devices
showing active sessions across devices (using Phoenix Presence)
