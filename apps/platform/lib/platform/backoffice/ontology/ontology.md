An ontology is a description (like a formal specification of a program) of the
concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community
of agents. This definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set of
concept definitions, but more general. And it is a different sense of the word
than its use in philosophy. - Gruber

Ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of classes, class
definitions, and the subsumption relation, but ontologies need not be limited
to these forms. Ontologies are also not limited to conservative definitions â€”
that is, definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce
terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world.[13] To specify a
conceptualization, one needs to state axioms that do constrain the possible
interpretations for the defined terms. - Gruber
