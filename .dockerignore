# Ignore the following directories when doing a Docker build.
# These directories will contain artifacts for local (not-in-Docker) builds,
# and it is best to omit them to ensure a clean build in Docker.

# Note: If you are using an umbrella app, you might need to add more
# directories to this list.

apps/platform_web/_build
apps/platform_web/deps
apps/platform_web/test
apps/platform_web/assets/node_modules
